### TODO ###

 * main resource that translates short urls to a 302 redirect (DONE)
 * short resource serves up index.html (DONE)
 * tweak css so we see the full path in the UI. (DONE)
 * port to use postgres database (*)
 * add goto button on UI to see we get 302 redirect.
 * write out long form blog post as Markdown
 * checking what gen_S are running

 Nice to have:
 * fault tolerance for event handler, how should it's supervisor look, what
   happens when something errors out?
 * generate shorter unique links
 * gen_event calls to tally statistics on how many urls get visited, etc
 * clean up javascript to provide a copy to paste bin implementation
 * deploy to heroku (DONE) (http://fast-sea-3371.herokuapp.com/)
 * check whether link already exists and return correct code
 * add support for viewing events generated by the server

## Deploy

Setup heroku

    heroku create --buildpack "https://github.com/archaelus/heroku-buildpack-erlang.git"

To deploy latest commited change just:

    git push heroku master

The last line of the output will show the url for your app.

Uses the heroku build pack here https://github.com/archaelus/heroku-buildpack-erlang
If the app doesn't start use `heroku logs` to see why it's failing

   link and provides a 302 redirect to the correct location
 * erlio_link_resource   -  gets links from the application
